# Nick's 3d models

this repository exists to house my own personal 3d models that i have either created myself, reverse engineered from actual products/parts, or modified from other's open designs (with credit and permission, of course)

## layout

each directory is a self contained project, with CAD files, and an `.STL` of the rendered part/assembly.

There may or may not be a `README.md` for each project, depending on how motivated i feel on a given day.
