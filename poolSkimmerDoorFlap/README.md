# Above ground pool skimmer door flap

I modeled this after the part it was replacing, which was for an Olympic brand skimmer, so YMMV.

From a new part listing on Amazon for a similar part:

```
Skimmer weir measures 4 5/8" x 5.5" ( 6.25" to the posts)
```

I have verified this part to fit *my* pool skimmer, but again, your results may vary, do your own research.

## 3d printing

I printed this on an ender 3 pro with .2mm layer height, and an infill of 10% in PLA.

yes yes i know PLA is not the best for this application, but PETG was on order, and i needed a test print anyway.
